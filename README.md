This is a quick mockup of how Linktap could provide a more native Home Assistant integration
by adding some extra metadata to the different entity config MQTT messages.

Requires:
1. `sudo apt install mosquitto-clients`
1. [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2)

To run:

```
pwsh ./Send-Messages.ps1
```
